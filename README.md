This is the repository associated with our submission. 
The repository contains the folder with the original Python scripts, the obfuscated Python scripts, the compiled Python scripts, and the polyglot Pythona dn C scripts.
These are the files we provided as input to the tools described in the paper, some of them being integrated directly in the repository and some of them used as a CLI. 
The interested reader can refer to the installation guidelines of these tools directly from their official websites.
